- 2026-08-21: Orientation found the marquee already uses Hacker News via direct client Firebase API fetches, with no existing HN endpoint under `api/`; cursor replacement currently executes JavaScript on every `mousemove` through `CustomCursor`.
- 2026-08-21: Owner confirmed seasonal trigger date is Christmas, marquee should remain Hacker News, and the secret word is `prawn`; no HN API endpoint is required unless later implementation needs one.
- 2026-08-21: Cursor fix committed in `e9de12c`; cursor movement is now CSS-only and no longer uses JavaScript on pointer movement.
- 2026-08-21: Bug fix committed in `f1173af`; Spotify real playback progress now advances locally between API polls.
- 2026-08-21: Easter egg list started: typing `prawn` outside editable fields reveals PRAWN MODE.
- 2026-08-21: Easter egg list updated: on local December 25, HOLIDAY MODE appears and can be dismissed for the session.
- 2026-08-21: Marquee kept as direct client Hacker News fetch, with reduced-motion static mode and HN discussion URL fallback for stories without external URLs.
- 2026-08-21: Full easter egg list: `prawn` keyword reveal; local December 25 HOLIDAY MODE seasonal reveal.
- 2026-08-21: Owner reported marquee was not visibly auto-scrolling, Top Secret did nothing, Spotify fallback was not useful, and footer had too much whitespace; follow-up fix keeps marquee moving, makes Top Secret reveal hints, replaces fake Spotify controls with an honest fallback link, and tightens footer spacing.

2026-09-10: Accepted portfolio upkeep resumes maintenance. Reproduced 10-second Spotify polling; implementing 30-second visible-tab refresh with request guards while preserving local playback animation. Production verification pending.
